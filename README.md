# SparkApocalypse

Demonstration of Sparks in OpenGL.

Developed for DreamWorks hackathon (https://github.com/usama-ghufran/fx_challenge_hackathon)

Finished in top 3 among 2000+ participants.


An app which implements various concepts of maths, physics and rendering along with head humming creativity, to show a beautiful world, containing sparks and er... some other objects like a rabbit for example ^_^

This includes:

* Interaction of sparks with some objects in the world
* Detection of collision of sparks. Bouncing of surface, splitting, air friction, gravity etc.
* Animation effects so the sparks look real.
